This is a simple python-Flask application to create your own local to-do list, Diary with tags and a simple Calendar.

Before you can use the app 
- You will have to create 3 files in the parent directory namely tasks.txt, dairy.txt and cal.txt to store you entries.

Here are all the features the Application has to offer,
- A Todo list on the top left corner, a dairy on the buttom left corner and the calender on the right-hand side.
- To mark any todo item as important you can add an '@' at the end of your sentence to highlight that particular task.
- To delete an entry in the todo list just click on the element you wish to delete.
- The Dairy view initially shows only the Date, time and tag of the entry, click on the entry to show the entire event.
- Click on the calender numbers to add calendar events directly without having to enter the date and the month of calender event.
- The number in '()' of every calender event indicates the number of days left for the event to occur.
