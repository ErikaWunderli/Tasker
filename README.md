## What is This?
This is a simple python-Flask Application to create your own local to-do list, Diary with tags and a simple Calendar.


## To Run this Application
- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages
- Use `python app.py` to run the Application


## Here are all the features the Application has to offer
- A Todo list on the top left corner, a dairy on the buttom left corner and the calender on the right-hand side.
- To mark any todo item as important (make them appear red on the todo list) you can add an '@' at the end of your sentence to highlight that particular task.
- Clicking on an entry on the to-do list deletes it.
- The Dairy view initially shows only the Date, time and tag of the entry, click on the entry to show or hide the entire event
- Click on the calendar numbers to add calendar date and month directly without having to enter them yourself.
- The number in '()' of every calender event indicates the number of days left for the event to occur.
